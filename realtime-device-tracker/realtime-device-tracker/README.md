# Real‑Time Device Tracker (Front‑End Demo)

**No IMEI, no unauthorized tracking.** This is a safe, legal UI demo that simulates real-time GPS updates so you can take screenshots for social media.

## Run
- Open `index.html` in your browser, click Login (demo), then go to **Live Map**.
- Markers move every 2 seconds via a mock in-browser "socket".

## Turn into a real app (ethically)
- Use a companion app (Android/iOS) to send GPS to your backend with user consent.
- Authenticate with revocable tokens, not device IMEI.
- Provide an in-app toggle to pause/stop tracking and a clear privacy policy.
